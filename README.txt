My Portfolio.
I'm a Software Engineer based in Houston, TX. My professional engineering focus is Javascript but goes far beyond and includes working with Node.js, PostgreSQL, React and others. Additionally, my project management and data analytics background allows me to collaborate with clients and teammates to create a thriving work environment.
